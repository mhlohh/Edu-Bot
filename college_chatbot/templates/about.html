  <h2>About EduGuide AI</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:14px; line-height:1.75;">
    EduGuide AI helps students discover the right college and course in India with a powerful
    filter system, AI-powered suggestions (via Gemini), and clean, ranked results based on NIRF/rating.
    You can filter by <strong>location</strong>, <strong>stream/course</strong>, and <strong>budget</strong>,
    then jump straight to each college’s official website or Google Maps location. Whether you’re targeting
    <em>CSE in Kochi</em> under a certain fee, checking <em>AI &amp; DS fees in Trivandrum</em>, or listing
    <em>top B.Tech colleges in Tamil Nadu</em>, EduGuide AI surfaces accurate, structured results quickly.
    Our dataset is organized for stable, fast lookups—no page reloads required—and enhanced with an AI fallback to suggest nearby or relevant colleges when an exact match isn’t available.

  <p style="margin-top:10px;">
    Pro tip: On the results list, click the college name to open its official site, or the
    <em>Map</em> link to view its location instantly.
